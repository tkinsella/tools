## Version History
- All scripts are currently at version 1.0.0 (Initial releases)
- Version 1.0.0 will be for the first upload of the files to github. Some of these scripts have been around over 10 years long before I had this account. I will slowly add to this repository over time. As I find myself re-using an old script, it will be added here.
- Version 1.0.0 Also includes maintenace I am doing: Adding a header block to scripts with info about them, fixing little issues. Getting them to a place I am happy with. At that point, I will version everything to 2.0.0 with a proper release and documentation and any changes moving forward will warrent a new version number.
